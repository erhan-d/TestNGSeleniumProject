	Merge conflict - it's when multiple contributors (2 people) changed same file. To resolve conflict, we can do couple things:

	1. Stash changes (if you didn't finish,and you cannot combine changes, stash your changes. In this case, you are not loosing changes forever.)

	2. Discard your changes (you are loosing your changes forever)
		either git checkout file or git reset --hard

	3. Resolve conflict
		first of all we have to commit our changes
		then pull
		And check conflicting files (fix manually or through other tools, like in intellij) 

		accept theirs changes
		accept yours (your changes)
		merge changes (compromise)

		once conflict resolved, we can commit and push changes to github

	4. Just clone project again and copy paster your changes (NO, but this is what people usually do)

GIT BRANCHES

What is branch? It's a one version of your project. With git, we can have multiple version of project that exist in parallel. Every branch can have independent commits history.

Ideally, everyone works on their own branch, and then once work is done, you can create pull request to apply your changes to the main branch. This flow, allows to review code before accepting ant=y changes.  

Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository.
Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches.
You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

git branch
* master

Master branch should have latest stable and confirmed code. 

Ideally, master branch shouldn't accept direct commits. Otherwise, changes can be committed without code review. 

In my project. test lead was review code. But if there is no team lead/test lead then we do peer review. 

Everyones code must go through review. 
But, test lead can decide/choose the flow.

Every commit must be reviewed. 

Commit code when you completed some work. 

I would commit my changes, whenever I completed automation of some user story. Then I would add commit message like: "completed automation of VYT-4321 Driver should be able to add fuel logs". It's not only about scripts, you can also add utilities, fix something...


The main idea is that we have to be careful with master branch.

In my applications repository, not testing framework, we had a lot of branches:

2.12 - versions of application 
2.13
2.14
2.15
release
master
dev
newfeature 
somedevolpers  


git branch name - to create a new branch


then we run git branch to see list of branches 

  dev
* master

* means that we are still on the master branch

How to switch to new branch?

git checkout branch_name - to switch to different branch

git checkout dev

Switched to branch 'dev'

git commit -a -m "" to add all files and commit, so you don't need to run git add src/ before commit

 git commit -a -m "added cars.txt"


[dev 34444b9] added cars.txt
 2 files changed, 16 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 cars.txt

 if you don't stage files (git add ) and miss -a, you will get "Nothing to commit" 

git log - to see history of commits. 

enter q to exit from log.  

-a -m   != -m -a : by Madina

git branch
  dev
  *master

git branch -d dev - to delete branch
Deleted branch dev (was 6f0f888).

git branch
* master


git checkout feature
git push --set-upstream origin feature - to push local branch to remote


Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)

Branch 'feature' set up to track remote branch 'feature' from 'origin'.

If you have this error, you didn't connect local branch with remote.

fatal: The current branch feature has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

To connect/create new remote branch on github branch: git push --set-upstream origin branch_name

### Protect master branch from direct commits and enforce pull requests with code review. Code review will improve code quality. Also, we will make sure that master branch has 100% working code.
Everyone works on their own branch, and then creates pull request to merge changes with master branch.

1. Go to settings 
2. Branches
3. Create rule: master
4. Select: 
	Require pull request reviews before merging
	Include administrators
5. Click create 
######################

	At this point, our framework is a combination of Page Object Model and Data Driven frameworks. Plus we use singleton driver class. 

 * When an assertion fails, don't throw an exception but record the failure.
 * Calling {@code assertAll()} will cause an exception to be thrown if at
 * least one assertion failed.
 */

 SoftAssert softAssert = new SoftAssert();

 softAssert.assertTrue();

In testng there  are 2 types of assertions: soft and hard. Until now, we were using only hard assertion. The main difference is when condition fails, soft assertion will not stop execution until reaching assertAll() method call. Hard assertion, will stop the test in case of failure.


@AfterMethod
public void teardown(){
	softAssert.assertAll()
}

Why we close browser at the end of every test? Because if tests fails, following tests will be ignored and never executed. 

Hard assertion: Assert.assertTrue() , all methods are static. 

         case "chrome":
                    WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
                    //to configure chrome browser for tests
                    ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions();
                    //to run tests without interface, set to true
                    chromeOptions.setHeadless(false);
                    driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions);
                    break;
